Very old piece of code to get supercomputing news from twitter feeds with TW API 1.0. The code must be updated to work with TW API 1.1.

It was my first iOS app, so the architecture/coding is beginner-like. 

Also, with TW API 1.O the XML parsing was quite a pain-in-the-ass and some parts of the code may look disgusting, I agree. With TW API 1.1 the Json parsing is a lot easier, but you will have to add some authentification procedure. 

Json libraries are in the Json Directory and all images in the images Directory.

The app was published in the App Store. It has been since replaced with Instant HPC as part of the Open Mobile Hub project.
