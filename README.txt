Very old piece of code to get supercomputing news from twitter feeds with TW API 1.0. The code must be updated to work with TW API 1.1.

With TW API 1.O the XML parsing was quite a pain. With TW API 1.1 the Json parsing is a lot easier, but you will have to add some authentification procedure. 

The app was published in the App Store. It has been since replaced with Instant HPC as part of the Open Mobile Hub project.
